You're the P character. The Evil, clever E is trying to catch you!

You must get to the bottom-right of the stage!

You have but one advantage, but it is slight:
    The stage you are moving through is unkempt and overgrown. Each time you play, the weeds will randomly
    generate. E will have a hard time moving through the denser patches of the stage, yet E will try to take the fastest
    path it can. You can move freely amongst anything that isn't a wall, without encumbrance.

Move by typing the letter indicating your direction, or the whole word (up, u, down, d, left, l, right, r)

You may also skip your turn by pressing the enter key.

To escape from this nightmare early, enter one of the following commands: (quit, q, exit, e).

There is no guarantee of escape. Are you feeling lucky?
